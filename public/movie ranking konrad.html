<h1> Best Movies According to Konrad </h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Opennheimer</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite movie. It is one of not many of them that i couldn't take my eyes off. <br />
    In the end I realised that I couldn't believe that movie about inventor of atomic bomb could be so intresting <br />
    and that music in it was wordless. I left speachless and amazed.</p>
<h3>Doctor Who</h3>
 <p>My favourite super hero movie.</p>
 <h3>The Flash</h3>
 <p>My favourite movie series.</p>
